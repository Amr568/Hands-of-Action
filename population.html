        <h1 class="header1">Population</h1>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            With over 8 billion people on the planet as of 2023, the interplay between population growth and sustainable development has never been more crucial, as a path towards a more sustainable future requires demographic foresight. This involves anticipating the nature and consequences of major population shifts before and while they occur and adopting forward-looking and proactive planning.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">How is it related to sustainable development?</h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Population growth and its management are foundational to achieving the SDGs. Each of the 17 SDGs is influenced by population dynamics, as they determine demand for essential services, resource consumption, and environmental sustainability.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Rapid population growth is closely linked to hunger, food insecurity, and poverty, as it puts pressure on resources and the economy. For instance, high dependency ratios caused by rapid population growth challenge sustainable economic growth. It also adds challenges when it comes to education, since ensuring access to a quality education in countries with growing cohorts of children and youth presents a significant challenge. On the health front, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional conditions continue to be among the most common causes of death in countries with rapid population growth. Moreover, high population density contributes to the spread of communicable diseases and heavily burdens health systems. Additionally, inequality in countries with rapid population growth is expressed in terms of fewer girls than boys going to school, high rates of girls giving birth before reaching adulthood, and fewer women than men in formal employment or political life.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">Why is it challenging?</h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            While some countries, like in sub-Saharan Africa, have high population growth rates, other countries, like East Asian countries and some European countries, face population decline. These unbalanced population growth rates endanger their social and economic stability. Furthermore, they drive many problems locally and globally; challenges include:

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2 class="sub-header2">Unemployment</h2>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Countries with youthful populations, such as those in sub-Saharan Africa, face high unemployment rates due to poor education and insufficient economies, which make job opportunities not cover the wide population.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2 class="sub-header2">Aging Populations</h2>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Developed countries, like in Europe and East Asia, are also facing population-related challenges such as declining fertility and aging populations. For instance, Japan has over 28% of its population aged 65 or older. This old population exhausts the economy, health systems, and pension systems.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2 class="sub-header2">Rapid Growth and Urbanization</h2>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Urbanization has risen sharply, with over 56% of the global population now living in cities. Although urbanization offers economic opportunities, in many developing countries, it has also led to overcrowding, inadequate infrastructure, environmental degradation, and the spread of slums.

            <li>
                <h2 class="sub-header2">Migration</h2>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Migration reshapes demographics globally and cannot be ignored as a reason for high population density. High migration rates may alleviate labor shortages in some developed nations but increase social integration challenges. Conversely, emigration in developing countries comes with problems like brain drain, as their human capital is invested in other nations.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2 class="sub-header">What about Egypt?</h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Egypt's population exceeded 105 million in 2024, with over 50% of Egyptians under 25, making it the most populous Arab country.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            With such a population, various challenges come. The youthful population of Egypt represents both a challenge and an opportunity. While it could drive economic growth, it raises the dependency ratio and pressures education, health, and employment systems. Additionally, with nearly 43% of the population living in urban areas, cities like Cairo and Alexandria are overcrowded and face internal transportation problems and high pollution ratios along with housing problems and slums. Gender inequalities are present in the form of educational gaps between males and females, particularly in Upper Egypt, low levels of political empowerment, wage disparities, and social constraints.
        </p>
        <img class="article-image" src="images\internal-transport-egypt.jpg" alt="The crowded roads of Egypt.">
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            The Egyptian government has taken serious steps to face these challenges and integrated population dynamics into Egypt's Vision 2030. Family planning initiatives have been launched, such as “2 kefaya”, to spread awareness and improve the availability of reproductive health services along with youth and women empowerment programs. Moreover, a lot of progress has been made in the field of housing since the government has built a lot of residential complexes to rehouse slum dwellers.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            We cannot forget to mention the “Haya Karima initiative” that was launched by President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi to localise the sustainable development goals and find effective interventions towards one of the most important societal issues, namely providing a minimum decent life for residents of the most needy communities in poor areas, unplanned urban informal slums.
