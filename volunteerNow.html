            The web is a great tool that helps us get in touch with people in need who are close as well as ones who are far away. At one moment, you are talking to the animal home on the other side of the globe, and before you know it, you are holding a smartphone app that links you with a group of volunteers that need some extra hands in Africa.
            It doesn't matter if you are a group that needs people, or a volunteer in need of a new project, here are 15 websites that match people with organizations in need.

        <h2 class="sub-header">How to find volunteer opportunities</h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Before you start the application process, please spend some time reading thoroughly the opportunity descriptions. I know that you are tempted to apply for positions as soon as you come across something new, nonetheless, believe me, the accurate knowledge of exactly what they are seeking from someone is the key as it will save you time in the future. Besides, you can also find the projects that are really in your interest and those that are based on your schedule so you can take part in them.
            When you’re all set to apply, think of it as a dialogue with them rather than a mere documentation submission. To be clear, they aim to get to know the real you! If the interviewers ask about your motivation for the job or the skills you have, express your natural thoughts and experiences. Keep in mind that those who are looking for passionate people who are involved in their charity programs may be you, too! Maybe just who you are!
