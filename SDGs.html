        <p class="article-paragraph">
            The Sustainable Development Goals, also known as the Global Goals, are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            The Sustainable Development Goals are the blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. They address the global challenges we face, including those related to poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace, and justice.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            The 17 SDGs are integrated as they recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others and that development must balance social, economic, and environmental sustainability.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">1. No poverty </h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Goal 1, eradicating extreme poverty for all people everywhere by 2030, is a pivotal goal of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Extreme poverty, defined as surviving on less than $2.15 per person per day.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Poverty has many dimensions, but its causes include unemployment, social exclusion, and high vulnerability of certain populations to disasters, diseases, and other phenomena that prevent them from being productive.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">2. Zero hunger </h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Goal 2 is about creating a world free of hunger by 2030. The global issue of hunger and food insecurity has shown an alarming increase since 2015, a trend exacerbated by a combination of factors including the pandemic, conflict, climate change, and deepening inequalities.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Shockingly, the world is back at hunger levels not seen since 2005, and food prices remain higher in more countries than in the period 2015–2019. Along with conflict, climate shocks, and rising cost of living, civil insecurity and declining food production have all contributed to food scarcity and high food prices.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">3. Good health and well-being </h2>
        <img class="article-image" src="images/african-boy-getting-checkup-by-doctor.jpg" alt="african boy getting checkup by doctor.">
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Goal 3: The Sustainable Development Goals make a bold commitment to end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and other communicable diseases by 2030. The aim is to achieve universal health coverage and provide access to safe and affordable medicines and vaccines for all.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Great strides have been made in improving people’s health in recent years. 146 out of 200 countries or areas have already met or are on track to meet the SDG target on under-5 mortality. Effective HIV treatment has cut global AIDS-related deaths by 52 percent since 2010, and at least one neglected tropical disease has been eliminated in 47 countries.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            To overcome these setbacks and address long-standing health care shortcomings, increased investment in health systems is needed to support countries in their recovery and build resilience against future health threats.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">4. Quality education </h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Education is the key that will allow many other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved. When people are able to get quality education, they can break from the cycle of poverty.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Education helps to reduce inequalities and to reach gender equality. It also empowers people everywhere to live more healthy and sustainable lives. Education is also crucial to fostering tolerance between people and contributes to more peaceful societies.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Progress towards quality education was already slower than required before the pandemic, but COVID-19 has had devastating impacts on education, causing learning losses in four out of five of the 104 countries studied.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">5. Gender equality </h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right but also a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous, and sustainable world.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Women and girls represent half of the world’s population and therefore also half of its potential. But gender inequality persists everywhere and stagnates social progress. On average, women in the labor market still earn 23 percent less than men globally, and women spend about three times as many hours in unpaid domestic and care work as men. There has been progress over the last decades, but the world is not on track to achieve gender equality by 2030.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">6. Clean water and sanitation </h2>
        <img class="article-image" src="images/water.jpg" alt="hands pouring water.">
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene is the most basic human need for health and well-being. Billions of people will lack access to these basic services in 2030 unless progress quadruples. Demand for water is rising owing to rapid population growth, urbanization, and increasing water needs from agriculture, industry, and energy sectors. The demand for water has outpaced population growth, and half the world’s population is already experiencing severe water scarcity at least one month a year. Water scarcity is projected to increase with the rise of global temperatures as a result of climate change.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">7. Affordable and clean energy </h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Goal 7 is about ensuring access to clean and affordable energy, which is key to the development of agriculture, business, communications, education, healthcare, and transportation.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Our everyday life depends on reliable and affordable energy. And yet the consumption of energy is the dominant contributor to climate change, accounting for around 60 percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Ensuring universal access to affordable electricity by 2030 means investing in clean energy sources such as solar, wind, and thermal. Expanding infrastructure and upgrading technology to provide clean energy in all developing countries is a crucial goal that can both encourage growth and help the environment.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">8. Decent work and economic growth </h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Goal 8 is about promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment, and decent work for all. Multiple crises are placing the global economy under serious threat. Global real GDP per capita growth is forecast to slow down in 2023, and with ever-increasing challenging economic conditions, more workers are turning to informal employment.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            A persistent lack of decent work opportunities, insufficient investments, and under-consumption contribute to the erosion of the basic social contract: that all must share in progress. The creation of quality jobs remains a major challenge for almost all economies.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">9. Industries, innovation and infrastructure</h2>
        <img class="article-image" src="images/workers.jpg" alt="2 workers in a factory.">
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Goal 9 seeks to build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Economic growth, social development, and climate action are heavily dependent on investments in infrastructure, sustainable industrial development, and technological progress. In the face of a rapidly changing global economic landscape and increasing inequalities, sustained growth must include industrialization that, first of all, makes opportunities accessible to all people and, second, is supported by innovation and resilient infrastructure.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">10. Reduced inequalities</h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Inequality threatens long-term social and economic development, harms poverty reduction, and destroys people’s sense of fulfillment and self-worth.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Inequalities based on income, sex, age, disability, race, class, ethnicity, religion, and opportunity continue to persist across the world. Inequality threatens long-term social and economic development, harms poverty reduction, and destroys people’s sense of fulfillment and self-worth. We cannot achieve sustainable development and make the planet better for all if people are excluded from the chance for a better life.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">11. Sustainable cities and communities </h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Goal 11 is about making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. Cities represent the future of global living. The world’s population reached 8 billion in 2022, over half living in urban areas. This figure is only expected to rise, with 70 percent of people expected to live in cities by 2050. Approximately 1.1 billion people currently live in slums or slum-like conditions in cities, with 2 billion more expected in the next 30 years.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            However, many of these cities are not ready for this rapid urbanization, and it outpaces the development of housing, infrastructure, and services, which led to a rise in slums or slum-like conditions. Sustainable development cannot be achieved without significantly transforming the way urban spaces are built and managed.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">12. Responsible consumption and production</h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Goal 12 is about ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns, which is key to sustain the livelihoods of current and future generations.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Our planet is running out of resources, but populations are continuing to grow. If the global population reaches 9.8 billion by 2050, the equivalent of almost three planets will be required to provide the natural resources needed to sustain current lifestyles.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Changing our consumption habits and shifting our energy supplies to more sustainable ones is one of the main changes we must make if we are going to reduce our consumption levels.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">13. Climate Action</h2>
        <img class="article-image" src="images/melting-ice.jpg" alt="melting-ice at the poles.">
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Every person, in every country in every continent, will be impacted in some shape or form by climate change. There is a climate cataclysm looming, and we are underprepared for what this could mean.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Climate change is caused by human activities and threatens life on earth as we know it. With rising greenhouse gas emissions, climate change is occurring at rates much faster than anticipated. Its impacts can be devastating and include extreme and changing weather patterns and rising sea levels. If left unchecked, climate change will undo a lot of the development progress made over the past years.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">14. Life below water</h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Goal 14 is about conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas, and marine resources. Healthy oceans and seas are essential to human existence and life on Earth.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            The ocean is intrinsic to our life on earth. Covering three-quarters of the Earth’s surface, it contains 97 percent of the Earth’s water and represents 99 percent of the living space on the planet by volume. Careful management of this essential global resource is a key feature of a sustainable future.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">15. Life on land</h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Goal 15 is about conserving life on land. It is to protect and restore terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and stop biodiversity loss.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Earth’s ecosystems are vital for sustaining human life; they contribute to over half of global GDP and encompass diverse cultural, spiritual, and economic values. However, the world is facing a triple crisis of climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">16. Peace, justice and strong institutions</h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Goal 16 is about promoting peaceful and inclusive societies, providing access to justice for all, and building effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels. People everywhere should be free of fear from all forms of violence and feel safe as they go about their lives, whatever their ethnicity or faith.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">17. Partnerships for the goals</h2>
        <img class="article-image" src="images/partnership.jpg" alt="volunteers putting hands together.">
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Goal 17 is about revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development. The 2030 Agenda is universal and calls for action by all countries—developed and developing—to ensure no one is left behind. It requires partnerships between governments, the private sector, and civil society.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            By  working together and giving our time and skills, we contribute to building connections between communities, and strengthening efforts to achieve sustainable development. The Sustainable Development Goals can only be realized with a strong commitment to global partnership and cooperation to ensure no one is left behind in our journey to development.
